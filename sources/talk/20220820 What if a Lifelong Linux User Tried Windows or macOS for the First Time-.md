一直用Linux的人第一次用Windows或MacOS会怎样?
======
Windows用户在换Linux的过程中会遇到很多问题. 那么相反，一直用Linux的人第一次用Windows或MacOS会遇到什么问题?

![一直用Linux的人第一次用Windows或MacOS会怎样？][1]

还记得YouTube频道Linus Tech Tips中Linus Sebastian[在Linux上玩游戏][2]的场面吗? 尽管终端提示了"你接下来要做的事情可能是有害的", 他最后还是删掉了他的桌面环境.

![Linus Sebastian弄坏了他的Linux系统][3]

考虑到Linus日常用Windows玩游戏, 换Linux肯定需要一定的时间.

所以这是Linux的问题吗? 还是Linus搞错了? 才不是呢!

[更多Linux版本和桌面环境出现了Linus遇到的同样问题][4]

难道说，任何对某操作系统不熟悉的用户在第一次尝试使用该操作系统的时候都会遇到问题?

接下来, 我们要来谈一个不同观点:

Linux用户第一次用Windows或MacOS会非常容易还是会和Linus用Linux的感觉一样糟糕?

这肯定是非常有趣的话题...

**Scott Williams** (一个高级DevOps工程师) 在一系列推文中展示了Linux用户第一次用Windows或MacOS的场面.

### 在Win11上怎么启用TPM2.0?

如何安装Windows的最新版本Windows 11?

> @vwbusguy \
> 来看我在能不能在这台用了4年的笔记本电脑上启用TPM2.0并运行Windows11. 这台电脑支持Intel PTT，所以应该会很简单?
> 
> @vwbusguy \
> Windows和MacOS有太多选项了. 所有专有操作系统的用户难道就不能一起开发出一种能适用于所有场合和个人偏好的完美操作系统吗?(尤其是适合我的使用环境和个人偏好)

[Twitter用户 @vwbusguy][5]

*怎样启用 TPM 2.0? 在BIOS菜单中怎么找? 启用 TPM 2.0 安全吗? 我需要刷一个更新版本的 BIOS吗? 更新BIOS的过程中我主版会坏吗?*

上面就是些每个Linux用户(甚至MacOS/Windows用户)在升级Windows11会遇到的问题.

With Linux distributions, we never have to do such a peculiar thing to make it work. Even in 2022. But, Windows 11 wants you to know about the BIOS settings or the TPM chip before you can upgrade to it.

While Scott mentions about an older laptop, it is worth noting that even with the latest motherboards (for instance Z590), you may have to tweak the BIOS or flash a newer BIOS version to support Windows 11.

This is incredibly inconvenient, even for technical users because updating BIOS comes with its own risks.

### Do I Need an Antivirus Software? Which One?

While Apple’s XProtect and Windows Defender should be good for basics, there are several options when it comes to Antivirus if you want enhanced protection.

> @vwbusguy \
> I'm surprised that MacOS doesn't even come with a modern web browser installed and you have to go to a website to download one.  That's not a great initial user experience.
>
> @NaheemSays \
> It is actually deeper than that. As a user of both systems, I think people subconsciously forget how weird Windows can be.
>
> Its biggest advantage is that it comes pre installed. First step of a new system: uninstall a lot of crap. Try even getting rid of Mcaffee or Norton!
>
> @vwbusguy \
> So do I or do I not need antivirus software and which one?

[Twitter @vwbusguy][6]

And, with so many choices and paid reviews online, it is tough to know what’s actually a genuine option and if you should spend for it.

A Linux user will often wonder: *Why do I even need this? Won’t this affect the performance? What do I do with so many protection features? Isn’t Windows a secure operating system?*

### iCloud and macOS: A Love Story?

> @vwbusguy \
> How do I access files on my @btrfs drive in Windows or MacOS?
>
> @vwbusguy \
> What is iCloud and how do I make this go away?
> 
> @mikecodemonkey \
> And then MacOS is sooooo annoying having to log into your iCloud every 5 seconds, set multiple passwords, constantly tell Siri to bugger off.

[Twtter @vwbusguy][7]

Linux users are not fond of integrated cloud services. They either mount a cloud storage drive (or a network drive).

Even if they opt for a cloud storage service, it should work as per their explicit actions. However, with macOS, you will be constantly reminded of iCloud while Siri popping up in between.

### Linux User Cleans the Registry

With so many options and tools to clean registries and optimize systems for better performance, a new Linux user may end up with an unresponsive Windows.

> Reddit says I need to "clean my registry" so I followed a few tutorials and deleted a few things and now this Windows box is acting really weird.

[Twitter @vwbusguy][8]

Even in 2022, there is no clarity when you work with the registry or tools that helps you “optimize” the registry.

Dare you, veteran Linux users love the details before trying anything. But, if there is no proper warning/notice in the GUI, how can one know about it all?

### Reboot All The Way

It’s not like a reboot does not fix things in Linux. But, how many times do I have to reboot when updating Windows or after installing software?

> We can all be like, \
> "You have to install how many .NET framework versions? How many reboots so far?" \
> "My Adobe version doesn't support this version of MacOS? No wonder people have so many have trouble taking MacOS seriously. Apple needs to fix this."

[Twitter @vwbusguy][9]

Every time I reboot, I lose the active applications that were in the background.

Why can’t Windows just detect the new installations and updated packages with a simple refresh instead of a reboot? Why is this so much counter-productive?

### Do I Have to Pay for All This? Wasn’t the Windows License Enough?

Linux is primarily all about free and open-source software. Hence, the pre-installed utilities are free.

So, a user who is comfortable with those tools would have to suddenly pay for a Windows license, and also pay for software.

Isn’t Microsoft too greedy here?

### Lack of Essential Packages by Default

I can’t even extract an archive after I install Windows? Is it truly a modern OS?

### Multi-Monitor Setup for macOS

> @vwbusguy \
> How do I get my monitors to work with MacOS?
>
> I'm used to firmware updates just being automatic through LVFS on Linux.  How do I update the firmware from Windows?  This vendor site says I need to put something on a USB drive.  Can I borrow one from someone?
> 
> @acruiz \
> Indeed!!!! I had to install several extensions on macOS to get to a semi decent setup (plus some shitty drivers for multimonitor support in my dock station which worked OOTB on Linux)

[Twitter @vwbusguy][10]

It is a breeze to work with Linux when you have a multi-monitor setup. But, when it comes to macOS, everything breaks away.

### Final Thoughts

Ultimately, it depends on what the standard is and what you are familiar with. Windows and macOS are often considered the standard desktop operating system.

In contrast, most people know little associated with Linux, except the fact that it is difficult to use.

However, if you get to know the essentials, just like you know for Windows/macOS, Linux desktop experience will be a smooth experience.

It is just because there are a variety of things when it comes to Linux. However, with patience, you can enjoy the full experience of it.

Linux isn’t problematic as a whole, it's the user that fails to get acquainted with coming from another operating system. We do not want Linux to be Windows nor Windows to act like Linux, everything should have a separate presence.

But then again, Linux should not be struck out just because a longtime Windows user did not have a good initial experience with it because the same can happen with a longtime Linux user trying Windows/macOS.
